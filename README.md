This project is a text-based game called "The Minion Game," which is built using Python. The game involves two players competing to create the most substrings from a given string based on specific rules. This game enhances string manipulation skills and logical thinking.

Game Rules:
Input: Players must input a single capitalized string or a single word without spaces.
Gameplay:
Both players use the same input string to form substrings.
Player 1 (Stuart) creates substrings starting with consonants.
Player 2 (Kevin) creates substrings starting with vowels.
Scoring:
Each player earns +1 point for each occurrence of their substrings in the original string.
The game ends when all possible substrings are created by both players.
Winner: The player with the highest score wins. If both have the same score, the game results in a draw.
